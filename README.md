📝 Simple To-Do List (Python CLI Script)

A beginner-friendly command-line to-do list app written in Python.
This script allows users to add, view, complete, and remove tasks — all saved in a local .txt file.
🚀 Features

    Add new tasks

    View all current tasks

    (Planned) Mark tasks as completed ✅

    (Planned) Remove tasks

    Tasks are stored persistently in a tasks.txt file

💻 How It Works

This is a simple Python script that uses:

    A text file (tasks.txt) to save tasks

    with open() for reading/writing files

    input() for menu-based user interaction

    enumerate() to number the tasks

    A while loop for continuous user input

📂 File Structure

├── tasks.txt         # Stores all your to-do items
├── todo.py           # Main Python script
└── README.md         # Project documentation

🧠 Example Usage

1. Add task  
2. View tasks
